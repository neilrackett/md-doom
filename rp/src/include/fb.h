/**
 * File: fb.h
 * Description: Framebuffer module — owns the single 32 KB cartridge
 *              framebuffer the m68k reads each VBL.
 *
 * Single-FB design: there is exactly one framebuffer in
 * the shared region (`$FA8300`, 32 KB, 320x200x4bpp). Double-buffering
 * happens on the ST side; the RP just writes into this one buffer.
 *
 * fb.c defines `fb_screen`, brings the cart framebuffer up with a boot
 * splash, and owns the m68k blit handshake (fb_wait_blit_ack /
 * fb_frame_done) that every publish is bracketed by.
